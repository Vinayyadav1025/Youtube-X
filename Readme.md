    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. for refrence I have added a `.env.sample` file. You can use the following template:

    ```env
    PORT=your_port
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    CORS_ORIGIN  = *
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = use your token like ejnfkifhddmKJHJGN97ukJYwudh
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
